**this was only made because groundplane wouldn't load when i tried to upload a devlog and this is better for when im working offline anyways**

# 9th Aug, 2025: Looked for parts on JLCPCB and looked at example schematics  
Type: Research  
What I did: Watched the USB speedrun video and decided to start looking at parts for USB A and C on jlcpcb. Also looked at example schematics of how to connect the 2 together.  
Issues I faced: Could not find parts with schematic symbol that matched the pins on examples on the internet. Not knowing how a USB works and what each pin meant did not help either.  
Next Steps: Figure out a better way to research. Understand how a usb works and understand the meaning of each pin. Figure out how to better find parts on jlcpcb.

# 11th Aug, 2025: Tried to understand starting from basics
Type: Research
What I did: Decided that my knowledge wasn't enough and started from the basics. Watched a video on how USBs worked and tried to look at datasheets of USB C.  
Issues I faced: still don't understand this 24 pin thing.  
Next Steps: Try USB A first, because video said USB A is a 4 pin thing. should be simpler to look at
